# PDF Management Tool

A client-side PDF management tool that lets you work with PDF files entirely in your browser. No data is uploaded to any server - all processing happens locally.

## Features

### üìë Merge PDFs
Combine multiple PDF files into a single document. Upload two or more PDFs and merge them in the order you select.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Split/Extract Pages
Extract specific pages from a PDF file. Use page ranges like:
- `1-3` to extract pages 1 through 3
- `1,3,5` to extract pages 1, 3, and 5
- `1-3,5,7-9` to combine ranges and individual pages

### üîÑ Rotate Pages
Rotate specific pages or all pages in your PDF document. Choose from:
- 90¬∞ clockwise
- 180¬∞
- 270¬∞ clockwise (90¬∞ counter-clockwise)

Specify pages using ranges (e.g., `1-3,5`) or use `all` to rotate all pages.

### üìä View Metadata
Extract and view comprehensive PDF file metadata including:
- File information (name, size, page count)
- Document properties (title, author, subject, creator, producer)
- Dates (creation and modification)
- Keywords
- Page dimensions
